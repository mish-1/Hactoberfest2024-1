## Word Guessing Game
The Word Guessing Game (similar to Hangman) gives you a random word to guess. You will be prompted to guess one letter at a time, and the game will reveal the correct letters in the word. You have 6 attempts to guess the entire word.

## Features:
1.The computer selects a random word from a list.
2.The player guesses one letter at a time.
3.The game shows how many guesses remain.
4.If the word is guessed correctly, the player wins. If the player runs out of attempts, the word is revealed.)


## How to Play:

1.Run the word_guessing_game.py script.
2.You will see the word as a series of underscores (e.g., _ _ _ _ _ ).
3.Guess one letter at a time by typing it in.( eg: if you typed 'w' if it is there in the word the '_' where that letter is will be replaced by 'w' shown as 'w _ _ _ _ '(if the word is 'w a t e r') if the typed letter is not in word you will get chwnce for another attempt ) 
4.You have 6 attempts to guess the entire word.


##  Requirements
Python 3.x (no external libraries are required)


## Future Improvements


1.Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) that adjust the number range or allowed attempts.
2.Add a scoreboard or track the highest score for multiple players.
3.Add more words to the word guessing game.
